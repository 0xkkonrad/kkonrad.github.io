Welcome to our tutorial on creating a blog post in Jekyll! This post demonstrates how to include images, categorize posts, and use tags.

## Including Images
To include an image in your Jekyll blog post, you need to place your images in a directory (e.g., `assets/images`) and use Markdown or HTML to embed them:

![Sample Image](/assets/images/sample-image.jpg)

## Using Categories and Tags
As you see in the front matter of this post, we've included categories and tags. These help in organizing content and improving navigation.

## Conclusion
Jekyll makes blogging straightforward with its simple Markdown and front matter structure. Enjoy crafting your content!
